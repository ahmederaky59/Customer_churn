# Customer_churn
**Customer Churn Visualization  It is a dashboard visualizing the customers who churn from the company related to some reasons, features, and their contract** 
Here is the dataset: [custmer_churn_dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bJM2PIosuFAu3hpxISyAelDfhcGstEo2/view?usp=sharing)
The metadata is here: [custmer_churn_metadata](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f9LfTUcYXfLtte9z-9I9GVY-HaTgfUIk/view?usp=sharing)

I made some changes in the data columns type, and transform the data.
I created table of the important measures that I need using DAX, some ranges like age bins and monthly charge bins, also I created some columns like ("Demographics_Age", "ContractCategory", "GroupedConsumption", "Age_Other") to integrate the data and make it readable.

Start visualizing...!

The dashboard has:
1. **Overview1**: gives a look in some important information
2. **Look deeply** : gives a deep look on the data to know more information
3. **Summary1** : Summarization of the information that any one can see from the dashboard
